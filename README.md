# Dlayer view helpers

Custom view helpers for the Dlayer vNext app, https://github.com/Dlayer/responsive-web-development

Some of these view helpers may be useful in your projects, they were created to solve 
problems within Dlayer vNext, they might be useful to you with minor changes. 

If a create a view helper that I think will be useful in other contexts I will add a version of 
the view helper into one of my other projects, https://github.com/deanblackborough/zf3-view-helpers
